## Further Resources:

- I recommend going through this [tutorial](https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/advanced-positioning/) (starts at heading "positioned elements for menus") as it teaches a commonly seen element in navigation bars which is a dropdown-on-hover. This will come in handy since this element is also featured on [www.dropbox.com/business]() the website we are going to rebuild on friday.
- [CSS Grid Medium Article](https://medium.muz.li/understanding-css-grid-ce92b7aa67cb) (**Medium Life Hack:** Many Medium articles require a pro account. By viewing articles in incognito mode you circumvent the 3 free articles per month rule)

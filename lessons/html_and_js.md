## HTML Retrieval

- Which values can you set on the `display` property?
- What is the difference between `display: hidden` and `display: none`?
- What is the difference between the selectors `body.is-dark` and `body .is-dark`?

## Let's get in Formation - HTML Forms

### input Element

#### input types

```html
<input type="text" /> Favorite Plant

<input type="number" /> Number of Cups in my Cupboard
```

<input type="text" /> Favorite Plant

<input type="number" /> Number of Cups in my Cupboard

### label Element

The `for` attribute of the `label` tag should be equal to the `id` attribute of the `input` element to bind them together.

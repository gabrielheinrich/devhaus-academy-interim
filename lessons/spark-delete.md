# Spark Delete Notes Challenges

1. Create a Delete Button in the Note.vue

- reroute to the Dashboard after successfull deletion

2. Add a Delete button for every note item in the Dashboard

This is a tricky one, since you would have to nest the delete button within the note item, which is a `router-link`. Think about refactoring the note item component. This would also be a good time to make the note item a component.

3. Additional Challenges

- filter your notes
- add new fields to the CreateNote view, e.g. expand the collection feature
- add a search bar
- add a ordered view by collections in your dashboard
